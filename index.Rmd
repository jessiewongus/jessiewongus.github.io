### Introduction

<img src="images/photo1.jpg" style="width:75%">

Hello my name is Jessie! I am currently a 2nd year MPH student at Columbia University with a concentration in Epidemiology and certificate in Public Health Research Methods. My public health interests are in global health, urban design, and social determinants of health.

You can catch me on the weekends on the hunt for delicious food. My current food obsession are chicken & waffles and boba.
