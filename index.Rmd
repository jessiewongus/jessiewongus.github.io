<center> <h3>Introduction</h3> </center>
Hello my name is Jessie! I am currently a 2nd year MPH student at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/), with a concentration in Epidemiology and certificate in Public Health Research Methods. My public health interests are in global health, urban design, and social determinants of health. I attended [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) for undergrad, where I completed a BA degree in Public Health and a minor in Environmental Design and Urbanism.

On this website you can find information about my academic and professional experience, as well as a flexdashboard with distinct plot types displaying information from a dataset called <ins>NY NOAA</ins>.
